## Project Description
When looking at eCommerce, it is critical do understand consumer behavior and market trends in order to succeed in the industry. In this project, our group's objective was to gain insights from a dataset sourced form a multi-category online store. The dataset ranges from October 2019 to April 2020. From this dataset, we worked to identify different trends and patterns accross various brands and categories. To accomplish this, we started by cleaning the data removing erroneous and duplicate entries. From there, we were able to transform the data by grouping it into different subsections. This grouped data was then filtered and used to create visualizations that showed different trends and patterns.
